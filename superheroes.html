     When I said I could rant about superheroes all day, I wasn't lying. It all started with the <em> Avengers </em> movie in 2012, and snowballed from there. I was never a huge fan of comic books when I was young, preferring massive bricks of fantasy novels. High school simultaneously degraded my attention span and increased my escapist desires. It was a tough world out there.

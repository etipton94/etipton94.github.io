    <h1>New York City </h1>

     New York is one of the greatest loves of my life. There's a duality to it--the New York of romanatics that is the famous skyline and rushing taxis and quaint coffeeshops full of struggling writers, and the darker side of barely concealed violence. I spent all of last summer, too cheap to buy a MetroCard, traversing the city by foot and learned more about the neighborhoods and people of my city than I ever knew. Maybe one day, I'll actually get around to writing them all down.

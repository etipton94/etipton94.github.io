    <h1> Hello! </h1>
    <p> Emma, 19, genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist...wait that's Tony Stark. </p>
    <p>Your name is Emma Tipton and you just turned 19 years old. You have a fondness for using the second person that has <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">absolutely nothing</a> to do with your current favorite <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com"> thing</a> on the Internet. Well, one of your myriad of current favorite things on the Internet. You also have a fondness for cat videos, but pretty much anything to do with computers is guaranteed to catch your attention. You're rather proud of your new status as an amateur programmer. You occasionally <a href="musings.html"> write down</a> things that are vaguely profound although you fear they often turn into rambling. Especially about <a href="superheroes.html"> superheroes</a>. Gosh, you love superheroes. Perhaps even more that you love cat videos. And cat videoes that have superheroes in them? Oh my god. So wonderful. </p>
